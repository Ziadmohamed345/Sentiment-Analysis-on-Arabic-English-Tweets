# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Arabic-English-Tweets

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets in English and Arabic, classifying them into:

English: Positive, Neutral, or Negative

Arabic: Normal or Abusive

Built with machine learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) and BERT, it demonstrates multilingual NLP techniques for social media text analysis.

Features
✔ Preprocessing for both languages (cleaning, normalization, stopword removal)
✔ Handling class imbalance (oversampling for Arabic data)
✔ Multiple ML models compared (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
✔ BERT for multilingual sentiment analysis (experimental)
✔ Visualizations (word clouds, class distribution plots)

Results
Model	English Accuracy	Arabic Accuracy
Logistic Regression	75%	88%
Random Forest	72%	86%
SVM	74%	-
